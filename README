ImageCaptionAnnotation
=================================================
The ImageCaptionAnnotation project was intended as a repository
for the ad-hoc files written in support of the Flickr30kEntities v2
re-annotation effort. Due to changing project requirements and
a strong focus on other projects, these pages contain enough
issues to render them mostly unusable.

At the height of their functionality, multiple users would
log in to imageCleanup_login.php, which would initialize their
individual session and send them to imgCleanup.php, which would
serve them individualized images to annotate (depending on their
difficulty tier). In this way, imgCleanup was the workhorse,
pulling image caption data from MySQL, displaying images and
captions along with box-chain associations and bounding box
overlays. This page also had two modes:

In coreference mode, users were shown captions' entity mentions,
which were color coded to correspond to chain assignments. Users
could then click on the subscripted chain IDs to change the assignment.

In chunking mode, users were shown captions' chunks (non-overlapping
text spans) with superscripted chunk types, which allowed them to
correct chunking errors.

Later, COCO_anno.php was added to serve a similar function for
the MSCOCO annotation effort, and COCO.php and Flickr30kEntities_v2.php
were introduced to easily review the image caption annotations.

In short, the pages in this project are in disrepair, but represent
significant effort to provide an image-caption annotation interface.
